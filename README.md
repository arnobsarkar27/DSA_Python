### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
1. gcd_basic.py - Basic and cumbersome GCD algorithm
2. gcd_min.py - A much shorter method, uses minimum of the three numbers.
3. gcd_no_list.py - Same as the minimum technique but without a list.
4. gcd_backward.py - Backward iteration to avoid unnecessary comparisons.
5. gcd_euclid.py - Euclid's algorithm for GCD
